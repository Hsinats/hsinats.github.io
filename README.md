### Options Dashboard and Calculator

I created a mobile application that lets users create custom options trading strategies with up to 5 legs (including stocks). Users are shown payoff curves for both now and at expiry. Users can also customize the date, implied volatility, and stock price, allowing them to explore the outcomes of potential earnings events, dividends, or breaking news stories on their investments. Finally, the app breaks down the effects of time and volatility on the user’s strategy and gives risk management insights. This was created in Flutter.

### Car Detector

I created a mobile app that detects cars, trucks, and buses and alerts users as a vehicle approaches. This is done through the use of pre-trained object detection algorithms and a custom alert algorithm.
